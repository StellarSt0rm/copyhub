	"nsfw": ##put 'true' if the copypasta is NSFW, put 'false' if it isn't,

	"directed-to": "##same as the above one!",
	"tags": [ "##put tags in this (->) pattern as an array", "##extract them via putting keywords of the copypasta", "##ex: if the copypasta talks about ants and Furries, put 'ants' and 'furries' as tags! (capitalization doesn't matter!)" ],
